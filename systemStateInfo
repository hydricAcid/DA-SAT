# System States

The values of which define a system state can vary depending on the computer itself. For example, 3GB of RAM being used will be defined as "high"
on a system with only 4GB of RAM in total, but will be defined as "low" for a system with 32GB. Because of this, instead of using fixed values I will be using
percentages in order to define whether a hardware component is in a state of high or low utulisation. 
Here are the percentages I'm planning to use: 
- average cpu usage: 0% - 39%, high: 40% - 100%
- average ram usage: 0% - 59%, high: 60% - 100%

Another factor to consider is that different operating system use hardware on the computer differently. For example, a GNU/Linux system typically allocates 
less resources on tasks than a Windows system since it is more lightweight. Therefore average RAM usage between Linux and Windows system will differ.
