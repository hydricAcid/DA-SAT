We can’t just look at a computer and see how much of the CPU and RAM is being used. We need the help of applications like “Task Manager” in Windows that put data into a graphical format to help visualise how much CPU and RAM is being used. What I plan to do is make a task manager application that transforms data from CPU and RAM usage into graphs that are updated frequently to show accurate information. Therefore, this task manager application is a way of dynamically displaying data to the user to inform them about their computer’s CPU, RAM and other hardware utilisation. This application may also allow the tracking of the temperature of hardware components, so users may test how much their computer heats up when they use certain applications. In order to collect data regarding this research question, there are a variety of tools, both GUI and CLI that can assist with this. 

Depending on the operating system, the computer also assigns variables to hardware values that are able to be accessed by programs with sufficient permissions. These variables will most likely be the way my program is able to access data about the computer’s hardware, and therefore displaying that data in graphical format. Regarding operating system support, my program will most likely only support GNU/Linux systems as that will be the main environment I will be developing in.

Gathering hardware utulisation information using BASH commands will be the primary way I gather data. I can use a BASH script to clean up the raw command outputs too so that they are prepared for presentation in graphical format. Comparisons of system states from different machines will also be another way I collect data so that my dynamic data visualisation can inform the user of the current state of their machine’s operation.
